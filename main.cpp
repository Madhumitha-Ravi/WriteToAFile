//Can you write a program in C (not C++) that reads arbitrary data from standard input and writes it to a file, please? 
//By arbitrary data, we mean that we donâ€™t want to put any limitations or restrictions whatsoever on the data a user provides via standard input. 

/*
Assumption 1 --> I am assuming that we do not need to create a new file for each run instead it will be appended to the same file
*/

/*
Return Value - 
return -1 --> Encountered Error while creating/opening a file
return -2 --> Error in while Writing the file
return -3 --> When the input is Empty
