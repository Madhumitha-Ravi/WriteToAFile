# WriteToAFile
Can you write a program in C (not C++) that reads arbitrary data from standard input and writes it to a file, please?  By arbitrary data, we mean that we donâ€™t want to put any limitations or restrictions whatsoever on the data a user provides via standard input. 
 
 Assumption 1 --> I am assuming that we do not need to create a new file for each run instead it will be appended to the same file
 
 Output is attached
